                    USA universities place great significance on diversity, meaning classes will consist of students of 
                    different ages, religions and ethnicities. This provides a stimulating 
                    and interesting learning atmosphere that motivates cross-cultural understanding and socialising.
                    Most classes will have no more than 20 students and the faculty member will
                    take the time to get to know students and their strengths. Interactive and practical 
                    learning are the basis of American teaching. Professors are usually willing to 
                    spend time outside of class to offer further support. Campuses in the US also offer 
                    an active social life with many clubs and organisations for students to meet other students
                    with similar interests and further career opportunities.<br>
